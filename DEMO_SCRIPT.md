## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)
**[Screen: Web demo page]**

> "Hi, I'm Ki Jie, and this is Lenz - an AI-powered manga translator built with Gemini 3."
> 
> "Traditional OCR translators just read text. Lenz understands the entire manga page - emotions, context, and cultural references."

---

## WEB DEMO (0:20 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Drag a manga image into the web demo]**

> "Let me show you. I'll drag this manga page into the demo..."

**[Watch bubbles appear one by one]**

> "Notice how translations stream in bubble-by-bubble. That's Gemini 3's streaming API in action."

**[Point to an emotion-styled bubble]**

> "See this text? The AI detected the character is shouting based on their expression and the bubble shape, so it styled the text accordingly."

**[Click a cultural note button if visible]**

> "And when there's a Japanese idiom, you get a cultural note explaining the reference."

---

## CHROME EXTENSION (1:00 - 2:00)
**[Screen: Switch to Comic Walker manga reader]**

> "Now let's see the Chrome extension in action on Comic Walker - a free, legal manga platform."

**[Click Lenz extension icon, show popup]**

> "The extension shows the manga's context - title and tags. I can toggle Quality Mode for more detailed translations with cultural notes."

**[Click Translate Page button]**

> "Watch as overlays appear directly on the speech bubbles..."

**[Wait for bubbles to render]**

> "Gemini 3's vision capabilities detect exact bubble positions, so translations overlay perfectly."

**[Turn to next page]**

> "When I turn the page, overlays clear automatically - the extension detects content changes."

---

## TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (2:00 - 2:40)
**[Screen: Show architecture diagram from README or code]**

> "Under the hood, I'm using:"
> - "Gemini 3 Flash for multimodal vision"
> - "Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming"
> - "Structured JSON output for precise positioning"

> "The backend is on Vercel, with CORS protection so only authorized domains can use it."

## CLOSING (2:40 - 3:00)
